# Segmentation-in-class
R-Code to demonstrate to students how to segment consumer data based on different variables

I used this R Code (sourced in part from https://rpubs.com/Koi_P/660327)  to demonstrate to my students how segmentation can be done using the k-means clustering technique. 
The dataset I used was derived from kaggle user shwetabh123, you can find it here: https://www.kaggle.com/shwetabh123/mall-customers?select=Mall_Customers.csv
